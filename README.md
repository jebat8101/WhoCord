# 🕵️ WhoCord

**Turn any username or Discord ID into a full identity profile.**  
WhoCord automatically scans Discord messages across mutual guilds for tracking links, resolves them to find connected social media accounts, cross‑references **700+ sites**, runs deep email intelligence, extracts EXIF data from avatars, and generates a polished AI‑powered OSINT report — all from a simple interactive menu.

---

## ⚡ What makes WhoCord different?

Most OSINT tools stop at finding profiles. WhoCord goes further:

- **Discord‑native link resolution** – extracts and resolves Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter tracking links shared by a target user.  
- **Full identity pipeline** – names, emails, locations, breach data, GitHub history, and even avatar metadata are pulled together into one structured intelligence snapshot.  
- **30+ integrated tools** – Sherlock, Maigret, Naminter, Blackbird, Holehe, h8mail, GitFive, GHunt, Scylla, Socialscan, and more, all controlled from a single interface.  
- **AI‑generated reports** – a LLaMA 3.3 (via Groq) summary that interprets the results for you, ready to read or share.  
- **Secure token storage** – API keys are stored in your operating system’s encrypted keyring, never in plain text.

## 📦 Features

### 🔍 Discord link extraction
- Searches messages across **all mutual guilds** (or a specific guild) for shared links.  
- Identifies tracking parameters (`igshid`, `fbclid`, `ttclid`, etc.) in Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and Twitter URLs.  
- Resolves those tracking links using ShareTrace to reveal the original sharer’s profile.

### 🌐 Username discovery
- Scans **700+ websites** using Sherlock, Maigret, Naminter, Blackbird, and Social‑Analyzer.  
- Spiders discovered URLs with Sociopath and Linkook to uncover even more related accounts.  
- Filters false positives with Socialscan before scraping.  
- **Blackbird** now brings 600+ additional sites with email‑based search and avatar extraction.

### ✉️ Manual email input
- You can optionally provide an email address in manual mode; it will be searched via Blackbird’s email detection and also forwarded to the email intelligence pipeline (Holehe, h8mail, etc.).  
- No more automatic email guessing – only real, user‑supplied emails are processed, keeping results clean.

### 📄 Profile scraping
- Pulls public profile pages (GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, etc.) with built‑in scrapers.  
- Extracts display names, bios, avatars, follower counts, blog links, and embedded emails.  
- Uses **Socid‑Extractor** to mine structured identity data from generic pages.

### ✉️ Email intelligence
- Runs each email through:  
  - **Holehe** – checks which sites the email is registered on  
  - **h8mail** – breach/compromise status  
  - **HIBP** (HaveIBeenPwned) – known data breaches  
  - **Emailrep.io** – reputation and risk score  
  - **GHunt** – Google account information (requires `ghunt login` once)  
  - **Scylla** – breach database lookup

### 🐙 GitHub deep dive
- Collects public GitHub activity, pinned repositories, and profile details.  
- Uses **GitFive** to dig up commit history, possible email addresses, and full name history.

### 📷 Avatar analysis
- Downloads avatar images and extracts **EXIF metadata** (GPS coordinates, camera model, date taken).  
- Runs **reverse image search** via SauceNAO to find where else the image appears.

### 🌍 Domain & history checks
- **WHOIS** lookups on blog domains found in profiles.  
- **Wayback Machine** snapshot availability for all discovered URLs.

### 🧠 Name analysis & identity scoring
- Predicts name origin, gender, and subregion using Nametrace.  
- Computes fuzzy similarity between discovered names.  
- Generates **confidence scores** to rank the most likely real‑world identity.

### 📝 AI report
- With a Groq API key, WhoCord sends the collected evidence to LLaMA 3.3 and gets back a structured markdown report containing:  
  - Executive summary  
  - Identity assessment  
  - Digital footprint  
  - Risk indicators  
  - Recommended next steps

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siv-nick/WhoCord.git
cd WhoCord
```

If you don’t have `git`, download the ZIP from the green **<> Code** button and extract it.

### 2. Create a Python virtual environment (highly recommended)

This keeps all dependencies isolated and avoids conflicts with other Python projects.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the environment:

- **Linux / macOS**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
  ```cmd
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Windows (PowerShell)**:
  ```powershell
  .\venv\Scripts\Activate
  ```

Your terminal prompt should now show `(venv)` at the beginning. To deactivate later, just type `deactivate`.

### 3. Install WhoCord and its Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs WhoCord **and** all required Python libraries (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `keyring`, `jinja2`, `openai`, `socid-extractor`, etc.).

### 4. Install external command‑line tools

WhoCord calls several standalone OSINT programs that must be available on your system. Install them with:

```bash
pip install sherlock-project maigret holehe h8mail gitfive naminter linkook sociopath
```

### 5. Install Blackbird (email & username search on 600+ sites)

Blackbird must be cloned into the project folder and its dependencies installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p1ngul1n0/blackbird
cd blackbird
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
```

> **Important:** Blackbird needs a large data file (`wmn-data.json`) that is normally fetched via Git LFS. If you encounter a `FileNotFoundError` for `data/wmn-data.json`, run these commands:

```bash
cd blackbird
git lfs install
git lfs pull
cd ..
```

If Git LFS isn’t available, you can also download the file manually from the **WhatsMyName** project:  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName/main/wmn-data.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebBreacher/WhatsMyName/main/wmn-data.json)  
Place it directly inside `blackbird/data/`.

### 6. Optional but powerful extras

```bash
# WHOIS lookups
sudo apt install whois          # Linux
brew install whois               # macOS

# GHunt for Google account info (requires `ghunt login` after install)
pip install ghunt
ghunt login
```

When you first launch WhoCord, it will automatically check which tools are missing and tell you exactly how to install them.

### 7. Launch WhoCord

```bash
discord-osint
```

The interactive menu will appear. You’re ready to investigate!

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Interactive menu (recommended)

```
==================================================
        OSINT IDENTITY PROFILING PIPELINE
==================================================
1. Toggle investigation tools
2. Set tokens / API keys
3. Start investigation
4. Save config and exit
5. Toggle debug mode
==================================================
```

- **Option 1** – Enable or disable any of the 33 tools with a single keypress.  
- **Option 2** – Enter your API tokens. They are saved securely in your OS keyring.  
  - Discord token (required for Discord mode)  
  - GitHub token (increases API rate limits)  
  - Groq API key (enables AI report)  
  - Instagram session (optional, reserved for future Toutatis integration)  
- **Option 3** – Choose `Manual` (investigate a username) or `Discord` (investigate a Discord user ID).  
  - In **Manual mode**, you can optionally provide an email address to be searched via Blackbird and the email intelligence pipeline.  
- **Option 4** – Save current configuration to `config.json` (tool toggles and mode preferences) and exit.  
- **Option 5** – Toggle debug mode. When ON, all subprocess commands are printed live to the console, and a debug log is saved to `investigation_cache/debug_logs/`.

### Command‑line mode

You can run an investigation directly without the menu:

```bash
discord-osint --mode manual --target someusername --output html --debug
```

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `--mode` | `discord` or `manual` |
| `--target` | username (manual) or Discord user ID (discord) |
| `--token` | Discord user token (overrides saved one) |
| `--guild` | Discord guild ID (for single‑guild search) |
| `--output` | `json`, `markdown`, or `html` |
| `--debug` | Enable debug logging |
| `--interactive` | Force the interactive menu |

---

## 📂 Output files

All results are saved in the **`investigation_cache/`** folder inside the project directory:

- `intel_<target_id>_<timestamp>.json` – the complete intelligence snapshot (structured JSON)
- `report_<target_id>_<timestamp>.md` – AI‑generated markdown report (if Groq is enabled)
- `report_<target_id>_<timestamp>.html` – interactive HTML report (if `--output html` is used)

Additionally, raw outputs from Blackbird and Socialscan are archived in:
- `investigation_cache/blackbird_output/`
- `investigation_cache/socialscan_output/`
